        <p>Sarah,</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love you, and I'm so grateful you asked me to write this.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These are just things l've noticed that worry me. | want you to feel better, and I think your doctor needs the full picture. Take it at your pace, l'm here as needed.</p>
        <p>You’re saying extremely concerning things when upset. A few times lately (three that I can remember) you've said you'd rather be dead or didn't want to live. The last time was when we talked about how this feels like past high energy
          spells, and you said you'd rather die than face the medicine cycle again. That scares me because our boys can’t lose you, I can't lose you, and I know you're hurting. I know these thoughts are scary for you too, and I want you to have
          support through them.</p>
        <p>You’re acting unlike yourself. I've seen you doing things that don't match who you are, like stepping outside of your morals in ways the woman I know wouldn't. When we talk about it, sometimes it's felt insensitive and borderline cruel,
          like it's not you talking. Even continuing to wear/display the red hair tie knowing that it hurts me. I don't think you'd choose to intentionally hurt anyone if you were feeling okay, it's not at all the type of person you are.</p>
        <p>The highs and lows. You've been super up some moments (full of energy, confident, hard to slow down) then crashing into stress or anger fast. It reminds me of times before when you weren't yourself, and I'm worried it's wearing you out.
        </p>
        <p>Your stress and sleeplessness. You've been gone a lot more, not sleeping much (even when our discussions haven’t been a factor) and juggling more than usual. Less so since I’ve picked up my slack around the home, but still, It's a lot, and
          I hate seeing you stretched so thin.</p>
        <p>Your irritability. Lately you’ve been driven to a dark place when met with frustration, I’ve seen you speak with hatred in your tone in a way I’ve never seen. This has been with the kids, me and Brady. It’s not that I think the situations
          weren’t frustrating, just that your reactions have been beyond what you would ever accept from yourself and I don’t think it’s you. I know you deeply love our children, I don’t think you’d ever choose to speak to them that way. It must be
          hard for you too.</p>
        <p>The parallels with past instances and the timeline of events beginning with stopping all meds, going through the seasonal weather element, grieving the death of your mother in law. There are so many tough things recently that are the exact
          type of things that historically have led you to times like these.</p>
        <p>You've said you don't want that dark place again, the depression after these highs. I get that fear, and I think your doctor can help you avoid it if they know everything.</p>
        <p>The last thing I’ll add is this entire situation is not all bad. You gave me valid criticism that has allowed me to open my eyes and get better. I’ll always appreciate that and I’m sorry that it took so long for me to hear you. I’m no
          doctor and have no interest in diagnosing anything, I just know what we’ve lived through and can correlate past experiences to now. I just want you to get better so you can be healthy, happy and fulfilled. For yourself and all who love you.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I just want you to be safe and feel like you again. You don't have to carry this alone, tell them what's real and do it for you. I love you, Sarah, always and no matter what.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p>Your Husband Aaron</p>
